## General Conclusion
The cost of real estate is influenced by many factors, from ceiling height to the presence of a pond or park in the area. By analyzing our data and removing outliers and missing values, we have identified all the factors from our information that affect real estate. We also noticed that prices in the central area are higher than in the general database, which is quite logical and confirms the correctness of the work done. In the future, we can use this data for other purposes.
